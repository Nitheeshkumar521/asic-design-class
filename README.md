# ASIC DESIGN CLASS

## LAB 1 - Create a C program which will caluculate sum from 1 to n, And compile it using GCC compilier

1)- Write a C program in text editor as sum 1 to n  

Following image will show about the image of the C program

2- Compile the code using GCC compiler and run the code to see the output

Image will show about the commands used and output of sum1ton

## LAB 2 - Compiling Lab1(sum 1 to n) C program with RISCV Compiler

1) We will run lab 1 program using RISCV Gcc compiler

2)In a new tab we will check the assembly code for C program we Run

Here we went to the "main"  when I calculted using calculator got (35)dec and (23)hex

4) Hence now we will use Ofast on the RISCV compiler and we will use the same C code 
image which describes about the commands

5) We got 12 instructions(byte adressing) in the main section (adress 100bo)

6) RISCV compilation output
 Code Compilation using RISC-V GCC compiler with a different optimization flag (Ofast)
we will compile the code with compiler flag set as -Ofast and then we will check the assembly code again

# LAB3-DEBBUGGING WITH SPIKE SIMULATOR AND RUNNING THE OBJECT FILE GENERATED BY RISCV COMPILER IN SPIKE STIMULATOR

1) Debug it in spike using below command and we need our program counter to run till 100b0 by using the below command
   ![lab 3 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d744c0d1-b465-4ec6-b4a5-02e805546aaf)

2) Next we have to modify the content of a0 below command
press enter then it will run the next instruction is lui a0,0*21
And then we will ger the next instruction as addi sp,sp,-16

3)As stack pointer content updated by -16. Quit the spike by pressing q 
![lab 3 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1440c67-95cf-44d4-a004-9d784f0ac688)

4)And we will follow the steps as follow from step1(Enter the spike stimulation again)
